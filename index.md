# Cervical Cancer AI Suite for PAVE

Welcome to the PAVE project's AI research collection. This site showcases our projects focused on developing AI solutions for cervical cancer detection, analysis, and treatment planning.

## Background

The **HPV-automated visual evaluation (PAVE) Study** is an extensive, multinational initiative designed to advance cervical cancer prevention in resource-constrained regions. Cervical cancer disproportionally affects regions with limited access to preventive measures. PAVE aims to assess a novel screening-triage-treatment strategy integrating self-sampled HPV testing, deep-learning-based automated visual evaluation (AVE), and targeted therapies.

## Methods

Phase 1 of the PAVE effort involved screening up to 50,000 women aged 25-49 across nine countries, using self-collected vaginal samples for hierarchical HPV evaluation: HPV16, else HPV18/45, else HPV31/33/35/52/58, else HPV39/51/56/59/68 else negative. HPV-positive individuals undergo further evaluation, including pelvic exams, cervical imaging, and biopsies. AVE algorithms analyze images, assigning risk scores for precancer, validated against histologic high-grade precancer.

## Results

Triage of positives combines HPV genotyping (four groups in order of cancer risk) and visual inspection assisted by automated cervical visual evaluation (AVE) that classifies cervical appearance as severe, indeterminate, or normal. Data from 1832 HPV-positive participants across nine clinical sites confirmed that HPV genotype and AVE classification each strongly and independently predict risk of histologic CIN3+, with **<1% risk for the lowest strata and >25% for the highest risk strata**.

## Next Steps

Additional studies will focus on further refining AI algorithms, deploying AVE software and HPV genotype data in real-time clinical decision-making, evaluating feasibility, acceptability, cost-effectiveness, and health communication of the PAVE strategy in practice.
